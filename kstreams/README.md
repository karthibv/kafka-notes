# Kafka Stream Architecture    

The Kafka Streams API is a powerful way to process (Streams of data) with Kafka    

## 1. Simple to Flexible
    KSQL ->  Kafka Streams API ->  Producer/Consumer

    KSQL - SELECT..FROM , JOIN..WHERE, GROUP BY
    Kafka Streams API - filter(), map(), join() , aggregate()
    Producer/consumer - subscribe(), poll() , send(), flush()

## 2. Kafka Stream characteristics  
    1. Open Source    
    2. Elastic, Scalable, Fault-Tolerant, Distributed     
    3. Pwoerful Processing - Filters, Transforms, Joins, Aggregation, Windowing    
    4. Runs EveryWhere     
    5. Supports Streams and Tables    
    6. Exactly Once Processing    
    7. Event-Time Processing    
    8. Kafka Security Integration   

## 3. Kafka Stream Application - Anatomy
